# Gold Price Forecasting: ARIMA vs SARIMAX vs Prophet

* The trend of gold price is irregular over all years. This gold price dataset is taken from world gold council and measured in national currency unit per troy ounce. 1 troy ounce is equal to the weight of the gold = 31.1 grams. This dataset contains all the currencies of the world. But, this analysis based on Indian currency. 
* ARIMA models are designed to capture the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components of a time series. The autoregressive component accounts for the relationship between an observation and a certain number of lagged observations, while the moving average component considers the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a regression of previous observations. The "integrated" part of ARIMA represents the differencing operation used to make the time series stationary, meaning that its statistical properties do not vary with time.
* SARIMAX extends ARIMA by incorporating seasonal components. It includes additional parameters to model the seasonal patterns and trends in the data, enabling the capture of repeating patterns that occur over fixed time intervals, such as daily, monthly, or yearly cycles. Additionally, SARIMAX allows for the inclusion of exogenous variables, which are external factors that can affect the time series being analyzed. These variables can provide additional information and improve the accuracy of the forecasting model.
* Prophet has the ability to produce accurate forecasts with minimal effort. It decomposes a time series into three main components: trend, seasonality, and holidays. It automatically detects and handles various types of seasonal patterns, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly seasonality. It can also handle irregular seasonalities. Sometimes, Prophet forecast better than ARIMA and SARIMAX.
* Let's dive into this gold price forecasting and check that which time series forecaster is forecasting best.
